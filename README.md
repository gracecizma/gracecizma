# Hi there! My name is Grace, and I'm a software developer with a passion for history, technology, and logic puzzles.

I studied history in college and developed a deep appreciation for the complexity and interconnectedness of the world. After graduation, I worked in IT support and learned how to troubleshoot and solve technical problems. I found myself drawn to the logical and puzzle-like nature of the work, and started tinkering with coding on the side.

As I delved deeper into programming, I discovered a whole new world of creative problem-solving and endless possibilities. I was hooked. I taught myself new languages and frameworks, and attended App Academy to round out my knowledge and become a full-stack developer.

When I'm not coding, you can find me reading history books, lifting weights, or exploring a new world in a video game. I'm always looking for new challenges and adventures, both in my personal and professional life. If you're interested in collaborating on a project or just want to chat about history or tech, feel free to reach out!
